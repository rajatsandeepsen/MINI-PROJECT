  \textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
The project focuses on developing a virtual assistant to streamline various tasks within a banking application, addressing one of the most daunting challenges faced by banks globally: the efficient processing of transactions and customer requests. The proposed system can implement a virtual assistant powered by a large language model (LLM) to tackle the pressing problem of manual data entry and processing. This transformative solution aims to enhance the efficiency and speed of banking operations. The need for such an approach was identified through customer feedback and research, highlighting the potential of this technology to revolutionize banking workflows.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent The idea of a user-friendly software tool that harnesses the power of validation libraries in conjunction with state-of-the-art Large language Model to convert user voice commands to navigate the interface of an multi platform application, was conceived. The system aims to simplify the complex navigation process by providing a user-friendly interface for users to capture images of the voice using a microphone that converts the voice commands into text that will be executed by Action model. The project enables the developers to effortlessly create their own Action model on top of any LLMs.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent The approach taken involved implementing a virtual assistant to streamline tasks within a banking application, making operations faster and more efficient. Utilizing a large language model (LLM), the virtual assistant was fine-tuned to handle various banking tasks with utmost precision and reliability. Leveraging cutting-edge frameworks, a seamless pipeline was engineered to efficiently process and organize data. The LLM interprets user queries and generates appropriate functions, which are then executed by an action engine. This engine processes the results and returns them in a JSON format, which is displayed to the user in an easily understandable manner.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent In summary, this project aims to reduce the time consumed for tasks within a banking application. While the initial focus was on transforming data entry procedures within banking institutions, one can envision a future where the modular system finds applications in diverse domains, simplifying complex data handling tasks and alleviating manual labor on a grand scale.
