\section{System Description}

The system can be described based on the five phases: 
   \begin{enumerate}
        \item  Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and process natural language user queries. 
        \item Translates interpreted queries into actionable instructions and generates JSON files. 
        \item Executes transactions based on JSON instructions by interacting with financial systems.
	\item Manages the secure storage and retrieval of transaction data using a connected storage bucket.
        \item Enforces user permission protocols to control access and ensure data protection.
    \end{enumerate}

\noindent The system developed in this project is structured around several key components: the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Interface, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and process user queries in natural language; the Processing Engine, which translates these interpreted queries into actionable instructions and generates corresponding JSON files; the Action Model, which executes the specified transactions by interacting with underlying financial systems; Data Management, which involves the secure storage and retrieval of transaction data using a connected storage bucket; and Security Protocols, which enforce robust user permission controls to manage access and ensure data protection. This integrated approach ensures a user-friendly, efficient, and secure transaction processing system that meets the evolving needs of modern financial systems.
